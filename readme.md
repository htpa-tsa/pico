Documentation per-problem for the [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) practice gym. **All challenges have been in previous competitions**. This repository has separated them by categories, which include:
- **Web Exploitation**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications
- **Cryptography**: Identifying and decrypting ciphertext
- **Reverse Engineering**: Understanding and manipulating the functionality of a program
- **Forensics**: Recovering data crumbs of supposedly deleted data
- **General Skills**: Everyday cybersecurity techniques
- **Binary Exploitation**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in machine programs

Of course, we impore you to try your absolute hardest before looking at this documentation. Or, for challenges with varying solutions, you can check out how we did them!
